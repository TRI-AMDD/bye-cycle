<p>
    Our recurrent neural network model inputs time-series data for current and voltage coming from a single, movable window of recent cycles, predicting near-term ($m_1$) and long-term ($m_2$) as slopes of the capacity fade curve in the consecutive prediction window. Approximately equal values of slopes (with small magnitudes) accounts for a healthy battery at early cycles, whereas diverging slopes show a likely failing battery at the vicinity of the knee onset. The resource-expensive training is done on cloud computers, however, the cheap-to-evaluate inference model can effectively run on low commodity CPU/GPUs, allowing for an on-board vehicle inference opportunity for cells in operation. Additionally, this approach can be insightful for qualifying used lithium-ion batteries with <strong>unknown cycling histories</strong> for second life applications.

Features
--------

`bye-cycle` uses a rolling window of cycles containing cycle-independant features (current and voltage time-series data) to make inference on the magnitude of the drop in cell's capacity. User gets to choose variations of input and output window sizes as a hyperparameter in reconstructing the discharge capacity profile.
