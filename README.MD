<p>
    Our recurrent neural network model inputs time-series data for current and voltage coming from a single, movable window of recent cycles, predicting near-term ($m_1$) and long-term ($m_2$) as slopes of the capacity fade curve in the consecutive prediction window. Approximately equal values of slopes (with small magnitudes) accounts for a healthy battery at early cycles, whereas diverging slopes show a likely failing battery at the vicinity of the knee onset. The resource-expensive training is done on cloud computers, however, the cheap-to-evaluate inference model can effectively run on low commodity CPU/GPUs, allowing for an on-board vehicle inference opportunity for cells in operation. Additionally, this approach can be insightful for qualifying used lithium-ion batteries with <strong>unknown cycling histories</strong> for second life applications.

Features
--------

`bye-cycle` uses a rolling window of cycles containing cycle-independant features (current and voltage time-series data) to make inference on the magnitude of the drop in cell's capacity. User gets to choose variations of input and output window sizes as a hyperparameter in reconstructing the discharge capacity profile.

abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have attracted widespread attention as an efficient energy storage device on electric vehicles (EV) to achieve emission-free mobility. However, the performance of LIBs deteriorates with time and usage, and the state of health of used batteries are difficult to quantify. Having accurate estimations of a batteryâ€™s remaining life across different life stages would benefit maintenance, safety, and serve as a means of qualifying used batteries for second-life applications. Since the full history of a battery may not always be available in downstream applications, in this study, we demonstrate a deep learning framework that enables dynamic degradation rate prediction, including both short-term and long-term forecasting, while requiring only the most recent battery usage information. Specifically, our model takes a rolling window of current and voltage time-series inputs, and predicts the near-term and long-term capacity fade via a recurrent neural network. We exhaustively benchmark our model against a naive extrapolating model by evaluating the error on reconstructing the discharge capacity profile under different settings. We show that our modelâ€™s performance in accurately inferring the batteryâ€™s degradation profile is agnostic with respect to cell cycling history and its current state of health. This approach can provide a promising path towards evaluating battery health in running vehicles, enhance edge-computing battery diagnostics, and determine the state of health for used batteries with unknown cycling histories.}
